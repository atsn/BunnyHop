#Bunny Hop


**I want to make it clear that i have not made this game from the bottom**
I have followed a guide for my teacher. 
This is a project that i have made for A Game Developments Class During my education. 
I have changes some things and added some things as well but I am not the maker of this game.

This git repository was made a good way in the process of adding stuff myself so not all the things I have added is clear

Here is a list over other stuff I have done myself
Stuff I have changed and why

*	I have made the jumping more flowing
  -	I have done this because the old jump felt heavy and was unpleasant to use
*	I have added a carrot power up that allows you to double jump
*	I have made a class Objective that makes it easy to set a new objective
*	I have made some more levels
  -	All level has a new element so you can see all the elements
*	I have added an enemy (the fox) if you hit it you are dead, but if you jump on it the enemy dies and you jump of it.
*	I have added a ladder with you can climb with the up and down button
*	I have added fire which if you touch you will die
*	I have added extra life. These wont respawn when you die unless itâ€™s a game over;
*	I have change the gui
  -	This change is made to give more information to the player
*	I have made it so a game over will send you back to level one
*	I have change to icon for the points from a star to a medal
  -	This I have done because other things then coins gives you point, and because I needed the coin for the objective and if it was in the gui twice with different meaning it could be hard to understand for the player.
*	I have made it so that you start each level with the amount of lives you had when you ended the last level
  -	This change was made because it seemed too easy if you started all the levels with fill life
*	I have made some cheat buttons to help test the game
  -	3 ends the level
  -	4 gives you a feather
  -	5 gives you a carrot
  -	6 gives you a star
*	I have fix a mistake where the game would still run even when paused
  -	You can only pause by putting the game out of focus
*	It was necessary to make methods to keep the fire and the foxes at ground level because of the way the level I loaded in so I have made these methods
